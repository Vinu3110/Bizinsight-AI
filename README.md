BizInsight AI — Automated Competitive Analysis & Report Generator
📌 Overview
BizInsight AI is a multi-agent competitive intelligence system designed to automatically collect, analyze, compare, and summarize competitor insights from product reviews and public data. It transforms unstructured text into actionable strategic reports, helping product, marketing, and strategy teams understand competitor strengths, weaknesses, and customer sentiment.

This project demonstrates Enterprise Agents, multi-agent orchestration, sessions & memory, observability, and structured output generation using Python inside a single Kaggle notebook.

🚀 Motivation — Why Agents?
Competitive research usually requires manually:

Searching for competitor information
Reading hundreds of reviews
Identifying key issues and customer pain points
Comparing feature sets and pricing
Writing a report
This is slow, repetitive, and error-prone.

Agents solve this by:

Splitting the workflow into specialized agents (collector, sentiment, themes, insights, comparison)
Running tasks in parallel (fast + scalable)
Ensuring each step is explainable and traceable (logs, session files)
Automatically generating reports that summarize all findings
BizInsight AI becomes a virtual competitive analyst.

🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture
1. Collector Agent
Fetches and normalizes product reviews (mock + real Kaggle dataset).

2. Sentiment Agent
Computes per-review and averaged sentiment scores.

3. Theme Agent
Extracts recurring topics such as battery, pricing, shipping, UI, etc.

4. Comparison Agent
Builds feature parity tables between companies.

5. Insights Agent
Generates high-level, actionable recommendations based on patterns.

6. Report Generator
Creates markdown reports and sentiment charts.

7. Orchestrator
Coordinates all agents using both parallel + sequential flow, manages session state, logs, and outputs.

🧪 Demo (Built-in Mock Data)
The notebook first runs with two mock companies:

AcmeCorp
ExampleCo
This ensures reproducibility without external data.

Generated Outputs:

report_AcmeCorp.md
report_ExampleCo.md
Sentiment histograms (*.png)
Session file (*_session.json)
Metrics file (*_metrics.json)
📊 Real Dataset Integration (Amazon Mobile Reviews)
The notebook integrates with the Kaggle dataset:

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/PromptCloudHQ/amazon-reviews-unlocked-mobile-phones

Steps Performed:
Load full dataset
Auto-detect text/rating/brand columns
Extract top 3 brands by review count
Convert reviews into orchestrator-compatible format
Run full agent pipeline on real brands
Generate reports + charts for each brand
🏗️ The Build — Tools & Technologies
Python 3 (Kaggle Notebook)
BeautifulSoup4 — lightweight parsing
Pandas & NumPy — data processing
Matplotlib — sentiment charts
Concurrent Futures — parallel agents
Custom lightweight sentiment analyzer
In-memory + JSON storage for sessions & memory
Structured logging for observability
📈 If I Had More Time
Enhancements planned:

Integrate LLMs (Gemini) for deeper summarization & extraction
Add real-time scraping tools (NewsAPI, web crawler)
Build a Streamlit/React dashboard
Implement trend detection using historical memory
Improve recommendation scoring with model-based prioritization
Add automated alerts (Slack/Email)
📝 How to Run
